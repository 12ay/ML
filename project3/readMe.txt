unfinished


I can't figure out why lines 160 (or 143) yields this error:

"UnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xac in position 1: ordinal not in range(128)"

or if I decode it to utf-8,

UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf8' codec can't decode byte 0xac in position 1: invalid start byte


Also, line 56 does not yield an error even though it's the same code
