This is a later version of project 3.
Any further changes to project 3 will be in this folder instead. 

As of 11/13, this project is able to read all the words in documents.
For each document, the 5 most used words are printed with the number of occurences.

Similarities between the top 5 words of the labeled documents and the unlabeled documents are lacking.
Therefore, for now, this project is unable to accurately classify each unlabeled document.
